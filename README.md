# flower_classification
Images of different types of flowers are classified using Deep Learning
Pretrained Densenet121 added with two hidden and one output layer is used to classify the flowers. Learning rate of 0.01 and 30 epochs are used to get training loss as0.31 and validation loss as0.0019.
Which in truns gives the test loss as 0.216 and accuracy 0f 94%.
For optimizing the model Learning rate of 0.001 is used with 10 epochs. Which gives the optimized training loss as 0.119 and validation loss as 0.0031.
